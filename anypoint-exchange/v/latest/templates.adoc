= To Use Anypoint Exchange Templates
:keywords: exchange, exchange2, anypoint exchange, templates, salesforce

Templates are projects that cover typical enterprise integration use cases. Find one that performs what you need, provide it user credentials, and it should be good to deploy! You can also customize or extend templates as needed.

All templates in the Exchange are built based on one of these data link:https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/top-five-data-integration-patterns[integration patterns]:

The examples and templates categories depend on the purpose for which each project is built: templates are almost ready to use just-add-water solutions, while examples are intended to increase your understanding of Studio elements and to build your own solution. Of course, if it suits your needs you could also end up using an example as a starting point for an actual deployable project or a template as a tool for understanding concepts.

== Implementing a Template From Exchange

Below are the basic steps for implementing any of the Templates in Exchange:

. Find the template that best suits your needs and click *Open in Studio*
+

+
. You can now see this project available in your package explorer, take a look at the files it contains:
+

+
[NOTE]
When you first open the project it may be marked as having errors, these should simply refer to the fact that the connectors being used in it need to be configured with your user credentials to work.
. Open the `mule-project.xml` file, located directly in the root level of the project folder, if you wish to deploy your app to any environment other than `dev`, change the value of the `mule.env` parameter.
+

+
. All templates in Exchange come built in so that to make them work, all you need to do is include your credentials in the configuration files. All of the connectors and global elements in the project's flows reference the fields in these configuration files, so (unless you plan on expanding or customizing how the template works) you never really need to modify or even look at anything other than these files.
+

+
Under the `src/main/resources` folder, find the file that corresponds to the environment that you selected for deploying in the previous step, then open it.
. Provide a value for each of the fields that the configuration file expects, this may include user credentials, port numbers, callback URLs, etc.
. To test your app, save the project and deploy it to Anypoint Studio's embedded run time by clicking the dropdown menu next to the `play` button and selecting the project out of the list.

+
. Now your app is ready to link:/#application-deployment-strategies[Deploy].

== Submitting Templates to a Private Exchange

You can submit individual Templates or multiple template versions to work with different Mule runtime versions. Just click the *Add Versions* button and then *Done* after filling in the version information. 

For each version you add, you have three options for linking to the Mule Project itself:

* *Download*: Link to an HTTP address where you host your Mule deployable zip file. Other people on your organization see a *Download* button on the Exchange entry, which allows them to import the project to Studio with one click.
* *Link*: Link to an external address, where they might be able to download the file and import it into studio manually.
* *No link*: Don't provide a link, your Exchange entry only contains a description.

For your project to be automatically importable into Studio via  Exchange, it must be packaged into a *.zip* file that must be structured in a particular way.

Exporting your project produces a zip file that has the necessary structure. 

To expose your Mule Project on Exchange from Studio:

* Select *File* > *Export*.
* Pick Mule > *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*
+

+
* Follow the remaining steps in the wizard to provide a name and location for your exported file'
* Host resulting .zip file in an HTTP server'
* Submit an example or template to your Exchange, add a version and reference this HTTP address in it'
