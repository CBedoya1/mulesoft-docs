= To Install a Connector
:keywords: install connector, connector, install, studio, exchange

You can only install a connector by first starting Anypoint Studio and clicking the Exchange icon at the left on the Studio task bar. 

All other ways to access Anypoint Exchange only lets you view details for a connector, but not install it. If a connector is already installed on your computer, the Installed button is grayed out in Exchange (accessed via Studio).

If a connector you need is not yet available for installation in Exchange, you can install the connector from Studio using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-connectors[Help >Install New Software] menu.

The steps for installing Connectors from Exchange into Studio:

. Click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar:

. Accept the terms and conditions and follow through the wizard, and allow Studio to restart.
. Search for the connector in Studio, and drag it to the Studio Canvas.
